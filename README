   
My Tiny Crypto Blockchain Simulator
===================================
Copyright (c) 2018 dmitrynizh

This is a toy but demonstrates many concepts of digital currency,
peer-to-peer distributed consensus and modern cryptography.

Each java file in this repo is standalone (independent).
CryptoBlockChain.java is the most complex one. It simulates a
cryptographic blockchain as outlined in the Bitcoin white paper.
To run compile and the simulator, you need JDK Java 8 or newer.

Compile:   % javac CryptoBlockChain.java
run:       $ java CryptoBlockChain

You can alter the behavior py providing command line parameters as integers:
 
$ java CryptoBlockChain <node-count> <coin-difficulty> <mining-batch> <block-count>

node-count      - How many nodes are in the p2p network. Each node mines new blocks. 
                  Default is 7 nodes.
coin-difficulty - Miners seek for that many zeros in block hash values they generate. 
                  Default is 6.
mining-batch    - Miners make random choices to generate from 0 to 10M * <mining-batch> hashes before updating. 
                  Default is 1
block-count     - The network shuts down after that many blocks were produced. Default is 10.

Examples:

$ java CryptoBlockChain 5
$ java CryptoBlockChain 6 7 5 3

The parameters coin-difficulty and mining-batch are somewhat coupled
as in a system with many nodes and transactions it is rarely possible
to mine with high difficulty in a small number of iterations before
accepting new transactions and blocks.

When the network reaches the block-count goal, nodes start shutting
down. Each node saves its blockchain ledger onto the disk.  The
consensus is demonstated when all such files are essentially
identical.

The rest of CryptoBlockChain is as described in the Bitcoin WP
(Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System)
except for the following

(1) no mechanism for the nodes to join and leave the network at will.
(2) no multiple input transactions (chapter 9)
(3) sender credibility not verified
(4) Merkle trees not pruned as described in ch.7, and in fact, not currently kept.
(5) no transaction fees
(7) reward is fixed at 50 btc
(8) nodes can not yet request a missing block (chapter 5)

Some of these limitations will be removed in future updates.

The screen log that appears when CryptoBlockChain runs contains what
nodes broadcast when the number of nodes is greater that 5. With 4 or less nodes, much more
is logged to facilitate debugging. At the moment the nodes broadcast the following:

Node's public key  :  PK <address> <pk>
Node's payment     :  TXN ... <address> ...  <address>  <signature>
Newly minted block :  BLN <hash> <prev-hash> .....
Halting broadcast  :  ALL HALT AND DUMP
Node's pk request  :  PK? <address> >

<signature> and <pk> are printed out in base64. Hashes are in hex.


Other files in the repo demonstrate various aspects of blockchain or cryptography:

BlockChain.java - simple non-cryptographic consensus over a peer-2-peer network 
GenHash.java    - produce key pair from text seed
GenSig.java     - initially derived from Java tutorial, expanded and re-written
Merkle.java     - simple demonstration of Merkle trees
Mine.java       - standalone (single-node) bitcoin-like hash mining engine
VerSig.java     - initially derived from Java tutorial, expanded and re-written
